Native link is an extremely (blazingly?) fast and efficient build cache and
remote executor for systems that communicate using the [Remote execution
protocol](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis/blob/main/build/bazel/remote/execution/v2/remote_execution.proto) 
such as [Bazel](https://bazel.build), [Buck2](https://buck2.build), 
[Goma](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/goma/client/) and
[Reclient](https://github.com/bazelbuild/reclient).

Supports Unix-based operating systems and Windows.

**The goals of this project are:**
<Steps>
  <Step title="Stability">
    Things should work out of the box as expected.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Efficiency">
    Don't waste time on inefficiencies &amp; low resource usage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="User First">
    Design choices should be optimized for what users want.
  </Step>
</Steps>
