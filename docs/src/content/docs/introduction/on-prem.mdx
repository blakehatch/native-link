While NativeLink offers robust cloud solutions, we understand that for various reasons such as compliance requirements, unique scaling needs, or specific infrastructure setups, you may need to run NativeLink on-premises.

Running NativeLink on-premises allows you to maintain full control over your data and infrastructure, ensuring that your build cache and remote executor remain within your network. This can be particularly beneficial for organizations with strict data governance policies or those operating in highly regulated industries.

To facilitate this, NativeLink is designed to be seamlessly deployable in an on-premises environment. Our team has worked hard to ensure that the process of setting up NativeLink on your own servers is as straightforward as possible, and we provide comprehensive documentation to guide you through the process.

Remember, our team is always here to assist you. If you encounter any issues or have any questions about running NativeLink on-premises, don't hesitate to reach out to us.

To get started with running NativeLink on-premises, we recommend taking a
look at our example deployments and NativeLink configurations that may suit
your needs.

- [On-Prem Example Deployments](../on-prem-example-deployments/on-prem-overview.mdx):
This section provides several examples of deploying NativeLink to an
on-premises Kubernetes setup. These examples aren't intended for production
use, but rather to serve as basic, illustrative guides for using NativeLink
in a custom Kubernetes environment.

- [Configuration Examples](../on-prem-example-deployments/configuration.mdx):
NativeLink uses a JSON file as the configuration format. This section provides
a few examples of configuration files that you can refer to when setting up
your own NativeLink configuration.

Remember, our team is always here to assist you. If you encounter any issues
or have any questions about running NativeLink on-premises, don't hesitate to
