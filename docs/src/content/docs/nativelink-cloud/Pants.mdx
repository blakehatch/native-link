To connect NativeLink to your Pantsbuild project, just add the code below to your `pants.toml` file. If you can't find a `pants.toml` file - create one in the root directory of your Pantsbuild project.

:::note

Fill in the `REMOTE_STORE_ADDRESS` and `API_KEY` from the [NativeLink Cloud](https://app.nativelink.com)

:::

1. **Configure your `pants.toml`**
   - Copy the following lines into your `pants.toml`:
     ```
     [GLOBAL]
     remote_cache_read = true
     remote_cache_write = true
     remote_store_address = "[REMOTE_STORE_ADDRESS]"

     [GLOBAL.remote_store_headers]
     x-nativelink-api-key = "[API_KEY]"
     ```

2. **Validate Connection**
   - Once you've added those lines to your `pants.toml`, run the following command to execute a build:
     ```
     pants --no-pantsd --level=trace --no-local-cache test ::
     ```
   - You will see remote cache utilization on the [Dashboard](https://app.nativelink.com/dashboard) page if your `pants.toml` is configured correctly.
